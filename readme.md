## Exercise

Today, we learned about Material Design. Tonight, using what you know, you will be providing your opinion on a website that is designed with material in mind.

You will be evaluating the [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/index.html) website.

#### Requirements

You should find a [thoughts.md](thoughts.md) file that you will add your thoughts to. When exploring the website, you should:

* Write at least 5 things that you like or dislike about the design
* Write at least 3 reasons why the website follows Material Design guidelines - be as specific as possible

#### Deliverable

Edit the [thoughts.md](thoughts.md) with your responses. Make a pull request, with the request titled "Your Name - Intro to Material Design Homework".
